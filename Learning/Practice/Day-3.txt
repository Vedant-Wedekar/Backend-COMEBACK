To define the structure of data, we use a Schema.  
Here is the boilerplate code for every model:  



import mongoose from 'mongoose';



const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    userName: {
        type: String,
        required: true
    }
});

export const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);


new topic is timestamps  use as a secondary object which gives two properties 
            a. createdAt
            b. updatedAt
